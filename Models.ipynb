    "to be specified as part of the configuration of the model. It's a bit\n",
    "unnatural.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first started experimenting I noticed that these constraints could\n",
    "result in practice schedules \"pushed to the right\" with low density\n",
    "slots to the left of the schedule because I had not expressed the \n",
    "idea of optimizing the amount of calendar time spent. As a heuristic,\n",
    "I decided to incorporate another variable: $TIMESOFAR_{i,t}$ defined as the sum\n",
    "of practice time for each item $i$ up to time $t$. The idea\n",
    "was to maximize the sum of these times as a \"timeliness\" metric. It ends\n",
    "up penalizing late completion for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time window is sort of awkward and creates some odd scheduling artifacts.\n",
    "Next I'm going to try different sorts of energy surpluses/deficits. where there\n",
    "are constraints that prevent it from going too high or too low. For each\n",
    "practice item a day of rest will deplete the \"learning\" banked, while a day of\n",
    "practice will increase it, but only within a threshold. Equivalent to production\n",
    "smoothing in other problems I've seen.\n"
