    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function is composed of three positive terms\n",
    "to be minimized. The first term (O1)\n",
    "captures the amount the sum of the total amount of practice time across all\n",
    "items. The second term (O2) is the relative energy expenditure on practice\n",
    "from day to day. This smooths energy expenditure, which has the effect\n",
    "of preferring spreading around the more energy-sapping work, and increasing\n",
    "the diversity with respect to intensity on any given day. I've included\n",
    "the constant term so that the objective values can be compared across different\n",
    "length schedules. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first two constraints are essentially supply and demand constraints. \n",
    "The time spent practicing must be equal to the time available (C1)\n",
    "and each item requires that a minimum amount of practice is done to master the\n",
    "item (C2). Note that, I could have relaxed these constraints and used a model\n",
    "similar to a transportation problem, incorporating dummy supply or demand. Instead,\n",
    "I assume that a shortage of supply will result an infeasible schedule, forcing\n",
    "a user to revisit the amount of time being allocated overall or per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints (C3) and (C4) are contraints that limit the number of consecutive\n",
    "days spent practicing. They are expressed in terms of a time window\n",
    "parameter. The goal is to ensure an adequate number of days spent resting while\n",
    "ensuring that practice is resumed before too long passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints (C5) and C(6) relate to energy expenditure. The equality\n",
    "constraints define the difference in energy expenditure from day to day. The\n",
    "difference $ERGI_{t+1} - ERGD_{t+1}$ of two positive variables captures\n",
    "this change. Either $ERGI_{t+1}$ or $ERGD_{t+1}$ will always be driven\n",
    "to zero by the minimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we require that the amount of practice of a given item on a given\n",
    "day $P_{i,t}$ is a non-negative *integer* to enforce the fixed-size\n",
    "practice sessions, and that all other variables are non-negative \n",
    "real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several known issues with this formulation that I will need to address:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incommensurability of the three terms in the objective function. A common metric that captures utility with appropriate scaling factors is needed. This should correlate\n",
    "with the expected \"satisfaction\" experience by the practicer. I'll need to add\n",
    "coefficients to the required Data that encode this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no constraints related to energy except for the smoothing constraint. \n",
    "It is probably desirable to specify minimum and maximum expenditures in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There's no way to say that after the required practice is done for an item\n",
    "that the rest interval increases. My current workaround is to imagine that\n",
    "the user organizes his schedule for some period of time around reaching the\n",
    "next plateau and then builds a new model based on the new levels reached. This\n",
    "may not be ideal. I'm not sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnostic Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The slacks and excesses are useful information for a user of the scheduling tool\n",
    "if presented properly. In addition, some efficiency-related metrics are\n",
    "probably going to be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time efficiency. Actual time spent practicing an item $i$ versus what's required:\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_i = \\frac{\\sum_t{P_{i,t}}}{timeper_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most and least efficient tasks are then $arg\\,min_i\\ R_i$ and $arg\\,imax_i\\ R_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Daily intensity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_t = \\frac{ERG_{t}}{timeavail_t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sums of these over all items may also be useful to present to the user."
