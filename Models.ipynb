    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function is composed of three positive terms\n",
    "to be minimized. The first term (O1)\n",
    "captures the amount the sum of the total amount of practice time across all\n",
    "items. The second term (O2) is the relative energy expenditure on practice\n",
    "from day to day. This smoothes energy expenditure, which has the effect\n",
    "of preferring spreading around the more energy-sapping work, and increasing\n",
    "the diversity with respect to intensity on any given day. Finally\n",
    "(O3) was the only way I could figure out how to express a preference\n",
    "for completing everything as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two constraints are essentially supply and demand constraints. \n",
    "The time spent practicing cannot exceed the time available for practice (C1)\n",
    "and each item requires that a minimum amount of practice is done to master the\n",
    "item (C2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints (C3) and (C4) are contraints that limit the number of consecutive\n",
    "days spent practicing. They are expressed in terms of a time window\n",
    "parameter. The goal is to ensure an adequate number of days spent resting while\n",
    "ensuring that practice is resumed before too long passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints (C5), (C6) and C(7) relate to energy expenditure. The equality\n",
    "constraints define the difference in energy expenditure from day to day. The\n",
    "difference $ERGINC_{t+1} - ERGDEC_{t+1}$ of two positive variables captures\n",
    "this change. Either $ERGINC_{t+1}$ or $ERGDEC_{t+1}$ will always be driven\n",
    "to zero by the minimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with (C8) we require that the amount of practice of a given item on a given\n",
    "day $P_{i,t}$ is a non-negative *integer* to enforce the fixed-size\n",
    "practice sessions, and that all other variables are non-negative \n",
    "real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several known issues with this formulation that I will need to address:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incommensurability of the three terms in the objective function. A common metric that captures utility with appropriate scaling factors is needed. This should correlate\n",
    "with the expected \"satisfaction\" experience by the practicer. I'll need to add\n",
    "coefficients to the required Data that encode this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's not clear that $TIMESOFAR_{i,t}$ is needed in the model (O3). It's not clear that preference should be given to completing tasks as early as possible. That is, it's\n",
    "not clear a priori that given excess days that \"packing\" the schedule is best. It may\n",
    "be that this is needs to be scaled in in some way (see above).\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no constraints related to energy except for the smoothing constraint. \n",
    "It is probably desirable to specify minimum and maximum expenditures in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnostic Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The slacks and excesses are useful information for a user of the scheduling tool\n",
    "if presented properly. In addition, some efficiency-related metrics are\n",
    "probably going to be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Re-practice ratio for an item $i$. Amount of practice beyond required beyond $TIMEPER_i$ over\n",
    "required practice (i.e., excess for the constraint). This is:\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_i = \\frac{\\sum_t{P_{i,t}} - TIMEPER_i}{TIMEPER_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most and least efficient tasks are then $arg\\,min_i\\ r$ and $arg\\,imax_i\\ r$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Daily intensity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_t = \\frac{ERG_{t}}{TIMEAVAIL_t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sums of these over all items may also be useful to present to the user."
